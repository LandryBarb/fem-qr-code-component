## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass Website



### What I learned

I basically built this in about half a day just to exercise my sass and html markup skills. I had a bit of block getting the elements to center on the page. Once past that everything else fell into place



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<p>I enjoy some of the methodology of CUBE css so I try and use that. I also try and limit how many classes I use. If it's not necessary I will just call the element in the css.</p>
<p> That's why the hgroup does not have a class</p>
<p>I also wrap my images in </p>

 <main id="main" class="[ main ]">
    <section class="[ wrapper ]">
      <div class="[ img_wrapper ]">
        <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr code">
      </div>
      <hgroup>
        <h2>
          Improve your front-end skills by building projects
        </h2>
        <p>
          Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
        </p>
      </hgroup>
    </section>
  </main>
```

### Continued development

Think I may change the image tag to a picture element possibly and further improve my sass stylesheets
